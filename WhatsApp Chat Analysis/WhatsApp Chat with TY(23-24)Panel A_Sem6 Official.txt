Companies now emphasise not only your academic achievements but also your Programming and Logical Development Skills along with Soft Skills.

Understanding the urgency of this situation, the Department of Computer Engineering and Technology is pleased to announce the Tech Skills Readiness Assessment for our current Third Year Students. 

This assessment is designed to help you identify the areas of improvement in your upcoming placement drive and bridge any gaps in your skillset.
